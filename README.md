# Flowtime-Study
Everyone has heard of Pomodoro methods where you study in interval of 25 min work 5 min break or its various variations. But it is not for everyone as not all people already have enough willpower to study for 25 min. And main problem of this method is that not all study material are created equal. Some material you may have difficulty reading for 10-15 min but for some you could go for even 40 50 minutes. It also depends on your condition during that time. Sometimes for same material you could study for long time but sometimes it is a chore to study for even 5-10 minutes. So, pomodoro is not always suitable.
But in this method you can study for however long you can by pressing Start Work and after you feel you need a break you press Stop Work and take a break. For break you can take a free break where you take break until you feel like you can study again. But I suggest setting a Timer with alarm. For example you can take a break according to your study time. 
This app helps us to build willpower as well. As you will feel your Study time increasing as you keep on using this program.
